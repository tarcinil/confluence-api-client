# Confluence::Api::Client

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/confluence/api/client`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'confluence-api-client'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install confluence-api-client

## Usage

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'confluence/api/client'

    username = 'username'
    password = 'password'
    space    = 'Home'
    url      = 'https://company.atlassian.net'

    client = Confluence::Api::Client.new(username, password, url)
    page = client.get({spaceKey: space, title: 'September'})[0]
    client.create({type:"page",title: "title", space: {key: space}, ancestors:[{type:"page",id: page['id']}]})

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release` to create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
